Selenium + Java + Element Locators {HTML} ==> This helps us to automate  the application or test cases

To gain more control over already automated test cases, we have to develop the framework
  -TDD [Test Driven Development]
     -JUnit
     -TestNG
  -BDD [Behaviour Driven Development]
      -Cucumber

      TestNG: All about 3 A's
      1. Annotations
          Are used along with methods
          @BeforeSuite
          @BeforeTest
          @BeforeClass
          @BeforeMethod  : This will be executed before every test case with @Test annotations
          @Test          : This is used to represent the test case
          @AfterMethod   : his will be executed after every test case with @Test annotations
          @AfterClass
          @AfterTest
          @AfterSuite
          ----------------------------------
          @Parameter
          @DataProvider

      2. Attributes
         WE use attributes along with annotations
           -priority: This is used to set the execution priority of Test cases
           -Enabled : enabled =false will not execute that test case
           -dependsOnMethods: This will execute only if depending Test case has passed
           -alwaysRun: this test will always execute, irrespective its dependent or not
           -invocationCount:this will run the test case, n number of times
           -groups: this is used for grouping the test cases
           -dependsOnGroups:This will execute only if all the test cases of the group passes
           -timeout: this will pass only if a test cases is executed within given time

           The default order of execution in TestNG is alphabetical order

      3. Assertions
          This is used to validate the scenario
          -AssertTrue
          -AssetFalse
          -AssertEquals
          -AssertNotEquals
          -Hard Assertion Vss SoftAssertion
